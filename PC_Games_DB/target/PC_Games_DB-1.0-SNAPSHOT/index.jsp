                <h3>In its Resident Evil Village showcase today, Capcom dropped the news that Mercenaries, the series' long-running arcadey action mode, is coming back. Mercenaries was especially popular in RE5 and RE6 thanks to co-op multiplayer support, but it wasn't included in Resident Evil 7 or the remakes of Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 3. "It's back, with a few Resident Evil Village twists," said director Morimasa Sato.</h3>

                <h3>As has become something of a habit in Call of Duty: Warzone as of late, a new weapon has been added to the game without notice from Activision. But unlike the relatively harmless Shadowhunter crossbow, today's new Sykov pistol is very good at killing.

                    By default, the Sykov looks and feels like any other pistol in Warzone, but it has a handful of attachments that could make it an overpowered beast. Once leveled, the Sykov can be configured to fire full-auto, equip 80-round drum magazines, and be dual-wielded to double up firepower. If you're keeping count, that's 160 bullets at an extremely high fire rate without having to reload.

                <h3>Days Gone now has a release date for PC, coming to Steam and Epic Games Store on May 18.

                    The biking survival horror hit the PlayStation 4 back in 2019 as one of Sony's first-party games. Earlier this year, the company announced it would be bringing "a whole slate" of their games to PC, with Days Gone being the first to arrive.

                    The game went up as a listing on Steam back in February, giving us a glimpse at the system requirements and also the inclusion of ultrawide monitor support. It'll also have unlocked framerates, improved graphics and includes all of the post-launch content featured on the PlayStation 4 version.</h3>
